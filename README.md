# NoSQL-Social Network API

This is a social network API, using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express and Mongoose packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.
